*HiLetgo Product*

The HiLetgo shield worked once I had compiled and upload the Arduino sketch.

The packaging was a solid cardboard box with the shield sealed in an anti-static bag.{nbsp}{nbsp}  This shield does looks very good.  It is fitted with the Wiznet 5100 Ethernet chipset and a Phillips 74xxxxx  - parts are of good quality.  The Ethernet RJ is Hanrun and therefore should last years.

The connectors came pre-assemble which I like - I have had to solder the connectors in the past.

Tested with Arduino example code and it worked - see picture below with the Arduino IDE, the terminal the Web Browser.

Nice and easy to use and this really should help people get up and running with speed.

The shield is for an Arduino UNO R3 or a MEGA2560.
