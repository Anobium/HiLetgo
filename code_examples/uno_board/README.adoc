*HiLetgo Product*

The HiLetgo UNO board worked at expected when delivered. Perfectly.

I was surprised by the quality and the layout of the board - the through-hole sockets for inserting DuPont wire is very clever.

The packaging was a solid carboard box with the board sealed in an anti-static bag.{nbsp}{nbsp}The required  USB cable was supplied.{nbsp}{nbsp}The board fitted other shields without issue.{nbsp}{nbsp}

The HiLetgo UNO board is a clean and with the addition of the through-hole sockets this is a good product.

The board uses a CH340 for USB connections and this caused no issues with the computers tested.{nbsp}{nbsp}
