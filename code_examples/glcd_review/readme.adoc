*HiLetgo Product*

The HiLetgo GLCD worked at expected when delivered.

The packaging was a solid carboard box with the GLCD sealed in an anti-static bag.{nbsp}{nbsp}The required stylis and the USB cable was supplied.{nbsp}{nbsp}The GLCD fitted without issue to the HiLego UNO board (other UNO boards were tested and the GLCD fitter these also).{nbsp}{nbsp}


The HiLetgo GLCD is a bright, 4 white-LED backlight color display that used an 8 bit digital interface, plus 4 control lines.  These is laid out on the UNO shield.


The UNO uses digital pins 5-9 and analog 0-4. That means you can use the other digital and analogs. Pin 12 is available if not using the micro SD
5V compatible, use with 3.3V or 5V logic

The shield is for an Arduino UNO R3 or a MEGA2560.

*Rating*

[red]#Excellent product.{nbsp}{nbsp}Fast and easy to use.{nbsp}{nbsp}Cost effective and the best GLCD ILI9341 shield tested.#

*Technical Details*
The ILI9341 is a 262,144-color single-chip SOC driver for a-TFT liquid crystal display with resolution of 240RGBx320
dots, comprising a 720-channel source driver, a 320-channel gate driver, 172,800 bytes GRAM for graphic
display data of 240RGBx320 dots, and power supply circuit.

ILI9341 supports parallel 8 bit data bus interface.{nbsp}{nbsp}  The moving picture area can be specified in internal GRAM by window
address function.{nbsp} {nbsp}  The specified window area can be updated selectively, so that moving picture can be
displayed simultaneously independent of still picture area.


ILI9341 can operate with 1.65V ~ 3.3V I/O interface voltage and an incorporated voltage follower circuit to
generate voltage levels for driving an LCD.{nbsp}{nbsp} ILI9341 supports full color, 8-color display mode and sleep mode for
precise power control by software and these features make the ILI9341 an ideal LCD driver for medium or small
size portable products such as digital cellular phones, smart phone, MP3 and PMP where long battery life is a
major concern.
